# Coding Club Data Visualisation Tutorial 3

## The aim of this tutorial is to quantify species' geographical range and visualise the impact of the Australian 'Black Summer' on invertebrates.

Following on from the <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/data-vis-2/" target="_blank">Data Visualisation: Part 2</a> tutorial, we will now be exploring alternative ways to visualise data through _concave hull maps_, and _hexagonal grid maps._
The possibilities for data visualisation are limitless, and this tutorial aims to equip you with two more powerful techniques for your toolkit!

### Prerequisites
Whilst this tutorial is of basic to intermediate difficulty, we recommend that learners go back and first complete the <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/datavis/" target="_blank">Data Visualisation: Part 1</a> tutorial and <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/data-vis-2/" target="_blank">Data Visualisation: Part 2</a> tutorial.

To get the most out of this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of the following:


- **Data manipulation with `dplyr`:** Transforming, cleaning, and filtering data.  

- **Data visualisation with `ggplot2`:** Creating plots to explore and communicate data patterns.  


### This tutorial will equip you with the following skills:

- Loading and cleaning ecological data for analysis.
- Generating spatial distributions of species using concave hulls.
- Visualising and quantifying species populations using hexagonal grid maps.
- Investigating the effects of natural disasters on biodiversity.

We also hope to demonstrated the power of open science and data-driven methods in advancing ecological research and conservation efforts through education!!
